# Voltage-Regulator
This project consists of a simple +5V to +3.3V voltage regulator breakout board. It uses the MIC5317-3.3YM5-TR regulator to step down a +5V input to a stable +3.3V output. The design includes necessary capacitors (C1, C2) for stable operation and two mounting headers (J1, J2) for easy integration into different systems. The project is provided with both schematic and PCB layout files, ready for manufacturing.

Key components:

MIC5317-3.3YM5-TR (Voltage regulator)

SM02B-GHS-TB (Connectors)

Capacitors: 1ÂµF (C1, C2)

This board can be used for powering low-voltage systems that require a 3.3V supply from a 5V source.
